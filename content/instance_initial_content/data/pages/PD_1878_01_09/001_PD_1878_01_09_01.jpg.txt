WAR DANCE |

AT THE

INSTITUTE.

 

 

There was a large audience in the Me-
chanics’ Institute last Monday evening
to hear Mr. Croff discourse on the Im-
agination. The people who gathered
on that occasion to hear a lecture got
something more in the shape of enter-

 

The goblet in question was a neat little
piece of silvey to which the lecturer
applied himself every three or fotr
minutes. It certainly did appear fo
have a very stimulating effect upon
him, although we refuse to believe tlt
it contained anything stronger than
water. Water certainly has a very
stimulating effect on some men, es-
pecially men who drink very little of it.

The persons most to be pitied in céa-
nection with Mr. Croft’s performance
were the President of the Institute and
one of the Directors, who were forced
to sit for an hour on the platform, in
full view of the audience, without
laughing once. It has been calculated

lecture, a gymnastic performance, acting,
singing, drinking,and various other feats
of a similar character, The effect was
electrifying. Some, indeed, went out
carly in the performance and refused
to hear any more from a man who, as
they expressed it, was making a fool of
himself. Others drew their brows into
a sullen frown and refused to laugh at
all, even when Mr. Croff made himself
most ridiculous. But the majority of
the audience, after ineffectual efforts to
LaslsYgrave abondensdtkamsolves tothe
contagious emotions of the hour, and
laughed until their sides fairly ached.
So lasting was the spell that Croft put
upon them, that for the next twelve
months most of that audience will
laugh whenever his name is mentioned.
The lecture itself was probably well
enough, if any one had possessed ears
long enough to hear it all, for most of.
it was taken from very common books.
One of its best sentences, that education
is an intellectual grindstone, is so an-
cient that it was probably remarked by
Noah to Japhet in the ark. But this
would have been pardoned had Croft
been content to read his discourse in a
decent and proper tone of voice. The
audience would have gone away, some
saying that Crotf’s lecture was dry, and
others that it was old, but none ot them
would have said that Croff was a fool.
Even now we cannot bring ourselves
to believe that Croff is an absolute fool,
although the evidence looks strong
against him. We are willing charitably
to say that he is a man who has set up
a mistaken ideal, and tried to act up
to it. It is true that he wears long
hair, which we take to be an almost
conclusive proof of weakness of mind,
but then there are some men who wear
their hair long because they think it
makes them look like poets and men of
genius. Spencer, the bung-hole poet,
is a conspicuous example of this form
of weakness. Croff has heard some-
where of lecturers who acted rather
than spoke, and in trying to imitate
them he has fallen into absurdities. He
has heard of lecturers who declaimed
in an elevated and grand tone, and in
attempting to imitate their mode of
speaking, he descended into rant and
highfalutin. The result of this artistic
error on the part of Croff was that the
only persons among the audience who
refused to admit that the lecturer was
crazy were those who charitably sug-
gested that he was drunk.
“Didn't you notice,” remarked one
lady, “how he always got worse after
he took a drink out of that goblet.”

We would have thought that the noble efforts
of Dr, Waters, on hehalf of St, David’s church,
would have insured him at least decent treat-
ment from his congregation. But it appears
not. At a meeting of the congregation held
on Thursday evening, they unanimously pass-
ed a resolution affirming thatit was Dr. Waters
that burnt down St. David’s church. Here is
the resolution ;

Resploed, That the congregation of St David’s
church desire to put on record their sense of
the obligations under which they lie, and tneir
gratitude to all those friends who have aided
them in ey the Church destrayed by the

fire on the 2oth June last, through the efforts
of our pastor—Rev, Dr. Waters,

This accusation is the more absurd, because
it is notorious that Dr. Waters was not in St.
John when St. David’s was burnt down. He
can prove a clear a/ii. It is not to be sup-

This is what Edward Abbot thinks of the

“ Passamaquoddy Bay is an appurtenance
of the Bay of Fundy, as is also the island of
Grand Manan; but to describe the Bay of
Fundy without mention of the fogs that harbor
in it, would, he as grave a short-coming as to
write a scientific treatise on fog without analy-
sis of the article as found in the Bay of Fundy.
IFogs, we may say, are never missed in the
Bay of Fundy, though dst is a feeble word to
denote them, To see the Bay of Fundy, in
fact, in some weathers, one might about as

well look on the map, and go no further.—
