THREE GENTLEMEN INDULGE

HOW THE TERRIBLE CONFLICT
IN THIS AMUSEMENT, A

i
VAS AVERTED.

 

Some time ago a young gentleman
become infatuated with a young Lady
and in a fit of spoonism gave her his
ring which dhe seemed to admire more
than himself, But judge of his sur-
prise when a few days ago he saw his
ring on the finger of another youn
gentleman. Very naturaly he on
ed of the young man where he got the
ring. But was told to mind his own
business; ‘bub after a little moral
suasion on the pa

Sometime in a man’s early life he

has pitched buttons. It is a sport that
has been fostered under the careful
guidance ¢f the clergy, and the laity
of nearly every church. No person
can find any fault with a small boy
pitching buttons, as money can neither
be made or lost at this amusement.
But boys now-a-days are not content to

their early religious seta is the!
newshoy, who is and has been for a
long time the leader in vagrant sports.
After the boy has grown into the man,
he is supposed to drop all childish
amusements, and adhere strictly to
business he has chosen
through the remainder of his life.
Such however is not the case as the
story we are about to relate conclusive-
ly proves. last Sunday two young
gentlemen engaged we belicve in a
bank in the city, anda very young
lawyer, who is also a resident of the
\ city, made up their minds fo have-ha
drive, and accordingly they went out as
far as the seven mile house, where they
found things very dull. They hardly
_ knew what tg do to kill time. Many
ays-gvere tried but none of which
proved equdl to the occasion, and time
hung’ so monotonously that one of the
boys Liowever, who was determined that
some fun they must have, and not-
withstanding that sabbath breaking
had been held up to him as one of the
worst of all crimes thatany man could
be guilty of, he proposed they should
pitch cents. No sooner said than
done, and pitch cents they did, much
to their disgrace. And still such men
aro admitted to the best society of the
city. Their acquaintance cultivated
by business men of tact and intelli-

give it up; bub "oF COUTEO refused, and
in consequence pistols for two were
ordered. Tort Howe was the place,
and sunrise the time appointed, a
Surgeon was also invined to
attend. But before the meeting took
place, the young lady procured the
ring from the gentlemen, and returned
it to the rightful owner, and there was.
a most blood-thirsty meeting prevented,
and the affair settled admirably. Much
pistol practice was indulged in by both
sarties to enable them fo be sure of
their aim, and one attained such per-
fection the day before, that he hit a
barn fifteen yards to the left of the
mark.” With this fact: in viewwe'd a
darned sight sooner be shot at by him
than be standing round to see the fun.

One of our city yo ng gentleman on
Monday night engaged a team for the
purpose of taking one of Indiantown’s
fair daughters for a drive; but the
young lady being a very bashful one
(something new by the way) decided
it’ would not be exactly the proper

A Quickeyep CoNSCIENCE.—During
a lull in the conversation yesterday af-
ternoon, Grandfather Lickshingle start-
led the family by remerking, “I've
lived one hundred years by the watch,
and never felt this way before,” and he
blinked in a very sorrowful manner.

“What's the matter,” asked mother,
who was at his side in an instant. “I
dont't know,” he said, “unless 1 have
a quickened consciense,” and he blink-
ed and stared by turns in a very alarm-
ing manner. “I feel sorter hot about
the ears,” he went on, “and mebbe I'd
better confess.

His whole frame trembled like a
leaf and a deadly palor overspread his
face.” A window was thrown open,
which seemed to revive him, and he
gasped, ‘“I-wrote ‘Beautiful Snow.”
“You did nothing of the sort,” yelled
father. "I wrote it myself, and I can
prove it.”

Grandfather then went on with his
confession : “I killed old man Junius
an’ wrote the Nathan letters. . Bind up
my horse! Give me another wound |”
Another window was opened. “I vot-

ed for Til.—.” Something rose in the

 

 

 

| comfortable of three. Dut the difficult
was surmounted by our city friend
gallantly offering his arm asa back
stay for the outside lady, which was
thankfully accepted, and pronounced
just the cheese. But alas it proved
otherwise, for as we are informed the
constant pressure brought on a severe
pain in her side, which has compelled

  
  
   
  
  
       
  

attendance of a physician, and now the
parents of the young Lady wants to
krow who is to pay the bill.

THOUGHT HE WAS GOING To BOARD.—
They were in the parlor together. The
light had goue out and they stood at
the window together in the radiance of
the moon. He had his arm about her
and was looking dreamily at the queen

of the night. Softly he spoke—

“ Darling I am thinking how happy
wo will be our own home when we are
married. It shall be a pretty home and
you shall be its dear little mistress.
We shall have a little parlor and a little
dining-room and a tit tle kitchen for
you fo manage. We shall be there all
by ourselves, and maf be so happy,
my darliny.”

“Oh, Henry,” i despondendenly
uttered, “I thought wo were going to

to kiss away, but he let Ler remove

“Coat. Makes tan Man.”—This was
a heading displayed at the top of the
advertisement of a merchant tailoring
establishment, and when we gazed upon
it we thought how often people are de-
ceived now-a-days by the outward ap,
pearance of a rogue in the Zuise of a
Man. Coat makes the man—yes and
in society too often conceals a heart
blackened by shocking crimes that are
never once thought of. How often wo
hear people, and especially the ladies,
express themselves in this manner: —
“How neat and well dressed.” Many
instances of this kind have been under
our notice, and hundreds of times and
instances we know in which just such
neat, well dressed people are plying the
most nefarious business of the country. -
