     we observed that it was addresed to the 
     
     PENNY DIP ofﬁce, we at once accused those 
     
     King street architects who gaze at passers by 
     
     with an opera glass. Our reason for putting 
     
     it down to them was that as theirearlycduca- 
     
    
   
   
    
     tion in manners had been neglected, so also 
     
    
   
   
    
       
     
    
   
   
    
     might their early school education have been 
     
     neglected. But later information tends to 
     
     show that it was neither the gift of an archi- 
     
     tect or a policeman, and the query was then— 
     
     \Vho sent the picture? This mighty question

     two others. One armed with what was once 
     
     called a bass Drum, and which the boys still 
     
     persist in calling such. The other juvinile 
     
     carries what is meant: for a tenor Drum, 
     
     which if we are not mistaken was once used 
     
     in the ﬁrm of Rankin é“ Song-and the lovers
