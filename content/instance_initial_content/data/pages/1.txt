     Ofﬁcers Donnelly and Rankin of Station 2, 
     
     at about midnight Saturday night, became 
     
     aware that some one had removed the trap 
     
     door leading to the engine l‘COHl in the base- 
     
     ment of the old church in Spring Lane, occu- 
     
     pied by a number of printing OfflCCS. \Vith a 
     
     lantern, thc ofﬁcers entered the engine room, 
     
     and found traces of a visitor in the vicinity of 
     
     the boiler. \Vilh the aid of a ladder they 
     
     climbed to the top of the boiler, where they 
     
     found that somebody had been toasting on a 
     
     gridiron. They still pursued their. search, 
     
     crawling through holes and labyrinths where 
     
     it was possible for a person to conceal him- 
     
    
   
   
    
     self. They ﬁnally traced their man to a nar- 
     
     row hole, from which they unearthed him en- 
     
     veloped in coal dust. He proved to be one 
     
     John Devine, alias Driscoll, who had entered 
     
     the place to sleep. It appears that Devine, 
     
     upon hearing the ofﬁcers outer, rolled oil” the 
     
     top of the boiler where he was feund, 
     
     and the fortitude he afterwards exhibited in 
     
     keeping quiet in the cloud of dust, which was 
     
     enough to choke any ordinary man, was 
     
     remarkable. He was as black as a crow af- 
     
     ter getting out of the place, as were also the: 
     
     ofﬁcers, and it was with difﬁculty that Lieut. 
     
     Bates recognized the latter when they returned

     There is nothing spoils the effect of obituary 
     
     poetry so much as the notice usually appended 
     
     —“ Other papers please copy.” It raises a 
     
     doubt as to whether the poet is anxious to 
     
     spread his own merits or those of the deceased. 
     
    
   
   
    
     If some of the reporters of the daily papers

     Mary Clemmer has been making a fuss in 
     
     the Boston and Washington papers, about the 
     
     indecency of actresses and singers in exposing 
     
     their persons. The Dramatic News says that if 
     
     she had been a young person with anything to 
     
     display, she would never have raised this dis- 
     
     cussion. 
     
    

    
     The P. 13. I. Patrict says that THE DIP is 
     
     apt to spread more heat than light in a, com- 
     
     munity. Heat is quite as necessary to exist- 
     
     ence as light. Oh! by the way, speaking of 
     
     “slashing and personal” articles, what about 
     
     The “ Degenerate ‘ Presbyterian’,” “that low 
     
     and scurrilous sheet”? 
     
    

    
     TRUTH Wm. OUT.—The other day in a 
     
     trial at the Circuit Court, one of our leading 
     
     counsels, who is rather inclined _to bullying 
     
     witnesses in cross-examination, was carrying 
     
     this thing to quite a height with a St. Martin’s 
     
     At last he said : “ Mr. So-and- 
     
     :0, you just now told me sO-and-so”—“I 
     
     “ \Vell,” 
     
     The 
     
     witness answered: “I hardly know what I 
     
    
   
   
    
     shipdniilder. 
     
    
   
   
    
     didn’t ! ” was the indignant reply. 
     
     askcd Mr. l‘., “what did you say?” 
     
    
   
   
    
     said; you go (11 talking in such a way tha 
     
     half the timc I don’t know what you say, and 
     
     consequently I don‘trknow what I saying 
     
     myself.” 
     
    
   
   
    
     The Torr/1‘: fashion department says that 
     
    
   
   
    
     the newest design in American fringes is named 
     
     after the Brooklyn Bridge, and (vidc fashion- 
     
     book) “prettin represents the latter in its 
     
     present stage of appearance, with suspended 
     
     cables and connected Lies.” Could we not, 
     
     Says the Torr/I, devise something as uniquet 
     
     and at the same time far-fetched? Certainly. 
     
     Could not some of our dry goods or millinery 
     
     people get up fringes to represent strings of 
     
     Dean’s or Hopkins’ sausages, or a design to 
     
     keep in mind those awful posts and chains 
     
     which partially surround liing Square? A 
     
     fringe ofeither ofthex: designs would, we think‘ 
     
     be sufﬁciently unique and far-fitchcd to satisfy 
     
     even the 'li'rr/a.
