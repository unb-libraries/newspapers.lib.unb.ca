A STRONG MAN.~The man with the iron jaw |

-< few men in the world to whom life
. apparently be so pleasant as to Mr.
«cnry Stanley; there are few, however, to
whom it seems to be so bitter: “All England is
ready to do him honor 4 he has been over-
whelmed with praise and congratulations ; the
Queen has received him ; Parliament has
thanked him; theltwo great journals for which
he has made his explorations have amply re-
warded him: but he is sullen, morose, discon-
tented and savage. This is strange; Mr. Stan-
ley is yet a young man, and life should still
contain much joy for him, What is the ex-
planation of this mystery ?

Mr. Stanley has had a romance ; it ended
unhappily for him, and this has soured him to
the heart. Before he went upon his second
expedition to Africa, he met and fell madly
in love with a charming young lady, the daugh-
tet of a wealthy citizen of Jewish extraction,
whose namie is perhaps best known in connec-
tion with the erection of an extensive but un-.
fortunate opera house. Mr. Stanley’s passion
was deep and violent, but he was told that, at
least, he must wait, and that an immediate
marriage was out of the question. He was
anxious to win even greater fame and fortune
and Jaythem at the feet of his beloved. It
was at this moment that the second African
expedition was proposed to him ; in it he saw
the coveted opportunity for distinction and
reward, and he eagerly embraced the perilous
commission, Throughout the ‘whole of that
terrible joumey through the jungles of Africa,
amid all his toils, dangers, sickness and dis-
appointments, he was sustained by the thought
of his love, and by the confident hope of receiv-
ing the reward which was dearer to him than
the applause of the world or the riches of Gol-
conda. He gave the name of the young lady
to the most beautiful leke which he discover-
ed, as he gave it afterward to the handsome
boat in which he made a’ portion of his ex-
ploration—the Lady Alice. At length, the
source of the Congo was found—the great deed
was accomplished, and Stanley returned with
ajproud and heavy heart to the coast. At
Zanzibar a packet of letters was awaiting him,
and he hastened to open them, hoping to find
some messages of love and affection from the
mistress of his soul. A fatal blow struck him,
One of the letters contained the intelligence
that Miss Alice—had been married several
months.

From the moment Stanley was a changed
man. His delight in life was wholly lost.
His natural good humor and buoyancy of spirit
gave place to long fits of melancholy, alter-
nated with violent outbursts of petulance and
anger, The plaudits with which he was re-
Curved upon his arrival in England were dis.
tasteful to him; he revenged himself by attack-
ing with unreasonable rage every ome who
ventured to differ on even the slightest subject
with him.

This, however, was Mr. Stanley’s second
love affair. Ife had experienced a previous
dissappointment, but it had not deeply wound-
ed him. Chancing to be spending some time
upon the Island of Crete, he saw from his
window a young Greek maiden in the garden
of the oppesite house, and he at once felt that
his fate was sealed. She was about fifteen
years old ; and Mr. Stanley has since declared
that never before nor since has he beheld so
sweet and beautiful a creature. He at once
sought out the American’ Counsul and reveal.
ed to him the state of his heart. The Counsul,
who had himself married a Greek lady, bade
him not despair; took him forthwith to the
house of his inamorata and presented him to
her mother, who was a widow. Stanley could
speak no Greek ; the mother no English ; the
Counsul was the interpreter. He did his work
so well that at the end of half an hour the
young lady was sent for, Stanley was forbid-
den even to tauch her hand 5 but he conversed
with by his eyes; they soon understood
each other well. At the end of a week he
was an accepted lover ; at the end of a fort-
night the day for the wedding arrived. All
this while he had seen the young lady once a
day, always in the presence of her mother,
On the day before the wedding he had been
permitted for the first time to take her hand
and to imprint upon it a chaste salute. The
morning of the wedding arrived ; Stanley was
dressed for the ceremony and was awaiting the
happy moment. There entered to him three
Greeks, whom he had never seen before and
an interpreter, They are introduced as
brothers of the bride, and they produce a
parchment, which the interpreter explains. It
