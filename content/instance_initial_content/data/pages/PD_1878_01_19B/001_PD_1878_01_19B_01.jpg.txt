——

He Could Get a Divorce.

THE MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE
IN MONCTON.

What Will be the Result.

It is certainly a very hard thing to
keep a mixed population pursuing the
course intended for them by a higher
power. When we say the course in-
tended we allude to the proper course
a man or a woman ought to traverse in
order to obtain true happiness and con-
tentment in this world of ours.

But here a little explanation may be
necessary in order to point out more
plainly what we mean. In the first
place
ONE WIFE IS REALLY

NEEDS

ALL ANY MAN
though in Utah we believe this doctrine
is contradicted, and the inhabitants se-
lect as many women as they can aflord
to keep, and as the feminine population
out there is in excess of the man, each
man who puts his head into the matri-
monial noose generally finds that, in
order to fully live up to the doctrine
of his church, he has to support from
three to sixty wives. In St. John,
however, the unfortunate man who
thinks that he has
LIVED SINGLE LONG ENOUGH,

awl ¢lermines to share his $300 a year
with a {air citizen, generally finds that
the woman of his choice can spend his
little all in six months, and that he has
to trust to luck and lottery prizes to
support him for the balance of the
year. But we have given enongh ex-
planation, and

WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH OUR TALE,
which is a somewhat peculiar and
eccentric one, as we understand the
hero of the tale is a citizen of Montreal,

and a contractor, who emigrated to this
eity shortly after the fire in order to
make a fortune out of the bluecnoses,
and whose name was made famous in
an embezzlement case which came off
in the Court House some ~time ago.

When this young man arrived in the

classic city of St. John he took up his
residence in a private family who live
almost under the shade of the Roman
Catholic Cathedral spire. In this fam-
ily was

SEVERAL MARRIAGEABLE DAUGHTERS,

and among them one whose personal
appearance had been admired by a
great many young men at different
times at Prof. Danielle's pleasant Wed-
nesday evening unions, which were
held during the winter of 75 and '76.
Unfortunately for the young man he
had found among the fair damsels of
Montreal one that suited his taste, and
he had become united to her in mar-

riage, at least so says report ; and if the
same authority is to be believed, one or
more children

HAD LEARNED TO CALL HIM FATHER.

The young lady was also hardly free
to say that she was in love with the
young builder, as she was generally
understood to have plighted her faith
to another young man who was in every
way calculated to make her happy.

This was how matters stood upon the
arrival of the Montreal man at her fa-
ther’s residence, but since then a de-
cided change has taken place. The
acquaintance thus formed soon ripened
into an intimacy, and the intimacy fi-
nally culminated in what was called a
very close friendship by the friends of
the young lady. In friendship the af-
fair was allowed to stand for some
time, but
SUCH A CLOSE FRIENDSHIP
as existed between the parties most in-
terested could have but one ending,
which was the final result, as we will
show a little further along.

She passed through the various
epochs of becoming acquainted and be-
ing a friend of the Montreal man with
safety, but the more that the acquaint-
ance ripened into a stronger feeling the
heart of the young lady was entrapped
and

A QUARREL WITH HER AFFIANCED
was the result, a too close intimacy
with the builder being the alleged
cause of the rupture between the once
two fond hearts. Ilardly had the dis-
carded lover departed from the pater-
nal roof than the young lady began to
pay rather marked attention to the
young contractor, and thus matters
went on for some time, and it is ru-
moved that she had stated several times
that she would have him

EVEN IF HE WAS A MARRIED MAN.

He could get a divorce. About a weck |

ago, however, matters culminated in

the young lady and the builder taking |

a trip to Moncton at which place they
were united in the bonds of
HOLY M..TRIMONY.

Thus ends a tale which, if true, and
we have every reason to believe it is,
plainly demonsirates that love is
stronger than matrimony, and that a
married man now-a-days can easily got
around the holy vow whieh he made
a few years previous, provided only
there is a woman in the scrape.

How he took it.

THE MAN WHO DID
THE DEED.

THE COWHIDE TAKEN
FROM HIM.

WE POSSESS IT AS A TROPHY.

A man entirely unknown to us
called at our office this morning and

used some very strong language in

. ‘
regard to an article «that ap-
pearetl “In “this - morning's « “Dip,

and threatened to take it out of the
editor's hido—1{o use his own words,—
and he was as rai as a bob-tailed bull
in fly time, so mueh so as to become
ludicrous when he meant to be dignified.
He was informed by the editor that he

could have the use of our columns

to deny the statements made in
the article. ~~ Paper was placed on
the desk to faciliate matters,

but as he evideatly lacked sufficient |

brains to do so sizaple a thing as write

an article in his own defence, he left,

apparently in good humor, and went

to a lawyer's office to have it written.
THE ROW.

The next we saw of him was, when

crossing down King strect, we noticed

gathered in front
Smith's

mall

and observed a

Henry bookstore,
leave there
and walk across King street with some-
thing in his hand, which afterwards
proved to be a bran new cowhide, in
the purchase of which he had probably
expended the entire contents of his
purse. He moved up to us with a
quick, nervous step, and asked if we
intended to give the name of the writer
of the article,—which was not given.
He then drew up the cowhide and
attempted to strike a blow at our head,

which was guarded and also

made several other to
strike with the cowhide, only one of
which took effect, and kept moving
backwards all the time until he had
reached the corner of Canterbury street,
where we stumbled and fell, and when

strike us, but was drawn off by the

all were ineffectual. When we had
thrown him off and got on our feet,
we wrenched the cowhide from him,
and being anxious to preserve it as a
trophy we allowed him to get our head
in chancery whez he administered a
severe blow in the eye, which was {he
only material damage done to our per-
son. After wrestling for a consider-
able time to get the cowhide back
again, he again closed and both fell to
the ground. In this fall neither were
hurt, as the crowd had gathered so

close around it was almost impossible

to move. The crowd then
separated, one part dragging

our assailant down King street, while
the other portion forced us in an op-
posite direction.
After having once grasped the cow-
hide we held on to it like grim death,
or a fly to the molasses side of a hoard.
It is now safely stored in the archives,
and 1s to us at once a trophy of a cow-
ardly assault, and the weapon of a
coward.
The party who committed the assault
is said to be one H. H. Bowie.
