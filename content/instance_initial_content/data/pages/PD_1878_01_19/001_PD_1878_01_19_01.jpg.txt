It is certainly a very hard thing to
keep a mixed population pursuing the
course intended for them by a higher
power. When we say the course in-
tended we allude to the proper course
a man or a woman ought to traverse in
order to obtain true happiness and con-
tentment in this world of onus.

But here a little explanation may be
necessary in order to point out more
plainly what we mean. In the first

though in Utah we believe this doctrine
is contradicted, and the inhabitants se-
lect as many women as they can aflord
to keep, and as the feminine population
out there is in excess of the man, each
man who puts his head into the matri-
monial noose generally finds that, in
order to fully live up to the doctrine
of his church, he has to support 4
three to sixty wives. In St. John,
however, the unfortunate man who
thinks that he has

with a fair citizen, generally finds that
the woman of his choice can spend his
little all in six months, and that he has
to trust to luck and lottery prizes to
support him for the balance of the
year. But we have given enongh ex-
planation, and

WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH OUR TALE,
which is a somewhat peculiar and
eccentric one, as we understand the
hero of the tale is a citizen of Montreal,

and a contractor, who emigrated to this
city shortly after the fire in order to
make a fortune out of the bluenoses,
and whose name was made famous in

an embezzlement case which came off

in the Court House some time ago.

When this young man arrived in the |:

classic city of St. John he took up his
residence in a private family who live
almost under the shade of the Roman
Catholic Cathedral spire. In this fam-
ily was

times at Prof. Danielle's pleasant Wed-

Unfortunately for the young man he
had found among the fair damsels of
Montreal one that suited his taste, and
he had become united to her in mar-
riage, at least so says report ; and if the
same authority is to be believed, one or

The young lady was also hardly free
to say that she was in love with the
young builder, as she was generally
understood to have plighted her faith
to another young man who was in every
way calculated to make her happy.

This was how matters stood upon the
arrival of the Montreal man at her fa-
ther’s residence, but since then a de-
cided change has taken place. The
acquaintance thus formed soon ripened
into an intimacy, and the intimacy fi-
nally culminated in what was called a
very close friendship by the friends of
the young lady. In friendship the af-
fair was allowed to stand for some
time, but

SUCH A CLOSE FRIENDSHIP
as existed between the parties most in-
terested could have but one ending,
which was the final result, as we will
show a little further along.

She passed through the various
epochs of becoming acquainted and be-
ing a friend of the Montreal man with
safety, but the more that the acquaint-
ance ripened into a stronger feeling the
heart of the young lady was entrapped
and

A QUARREL WITH HER AFFIANCED
was the result, a too close intimacy
with the builder being the alleged
cause of the rupture between the once
two fond hearts.

young contractor, and thus matters

HOLY MATRIMONY.

© Thus ends a tale which, if true, and
we have every reason to believe if is,
plainly demonstrates that love is
stronger than matrimony, and that a
married man now-a-days can casily get
around the holy vow which he made
a few years previous, provided only
there is a woman i the scrape.

offices are occupie:l by architects who have so
little business to attend to in their profession
that they spend most of their time. studying
the architecture of ladies passing in and out of

of the fair ones who do not like their ward-

Paradise Row seems to be a paradise for a
number of young men just at present. The
attraction which causes the young gentlemen
to meander in that direction of an evening
are a pair of very fine black eyes, and, like
Longfeilow’s maiden, the possessor ‘takes a
sly glance and looks down,” and no matter in
what direction—whether in the direction of
any particular gentleman or not—cach thinks
he is the favored one and immediately be-
comes demonstrative, waves his handkerchief,
or kisses his hand and wafts many a kiss
through the air-—which must be as satisfactory
as kissing by telephone or proxy. The young
gentlemen also “make night hideous” and
annoy the residents of adjacent houses, where
there are no eligible young ladies, by indulg-
ing in skylarking. The locality does not
seem to be favorable to some of the young
meht as one of them had to: be carted to a
