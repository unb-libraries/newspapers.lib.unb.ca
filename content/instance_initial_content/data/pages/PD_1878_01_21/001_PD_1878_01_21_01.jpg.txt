Some Street Scenes |

“Tuesday last was a grand gala day for fight-
ing men in this beautiful city of ours.

About dinner time two prominent gentle-
men indulged in a fre€ fight near the Golden
Ball Corner. This was the beginning of a
series of muscular exertions that were almost

appalling. This row was scarcely over when
another was commenced by a promising young
lawyer who, though rather lanky in form,
wears a tall hat, probably toadd a command-
ing look to his slim figure. He met with
another gentleman who is rather celebrated in |

meeting took place on King street, and after
a little talk the man of property, if our in-

Our ORTHOGRAPHY—N0 wonder that
foreigners complain of the difficulty of
learning the English language, for our
spelling i is wonderfully bad. Why do
we need ph to produce the sound we
give to f, when f will do as well? Of
hat use is.l in. would, could, and
X, ¥, and z, and
call them silent letters? So it is all
through the wide range of the English
language. We are hampered -angd
bound to the discordant cord of custom,
yet wo must follow the rules; we must
be goveaned by the standards. why
do we drag out p-h-t-h-i-s-i-c and then
call it tizzik 1 We write through when
thru would be better. We laugh at
Englishmen because they omit the
sound of the h where if is written and
apply the letter where it does not exist,.
Thus: “The hox it is orn and broke hit’
hoff,” instead of: “The ox hit his.
horn,” ete., and yet we pronounce
honour as though it were spelled onur.

If we pronounce it onur, according to

Webster, why not write it so? Iither
our - pronunciation or spelling, in

thousands of instances, is wrong.

Because of this, lexicograpoers are

obliged to spell many common words

for us, that we may know their cor-

rect pronunciation. * We need rules

in spelling.
