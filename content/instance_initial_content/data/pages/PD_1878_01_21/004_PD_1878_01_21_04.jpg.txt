CHAPTER IIL 2

5 THE DOCHART PIT.
& (Continucd.)

But just as they were about leaving ‘the
landing, a voice, still far off, was heard in
the depths of the pit. It came like a sonor-
ous wave which swells gradually, and it be-
came more and more distinct.

“Eh, who goes there?” asked the engineer,
stopping Harry.

“I cannot say,” replied the young miner.

¢]t is not your old fasher?” :

o Hel Mir. Starr. 10.7

‘“Some neighbor, then?”

“We have no neighbors in the bottom of
the pit. We are alone, all alone,”

“Good; let us pass this intruder.
who descend-must yield to those

They waited.

The voice now resounded with magnificent
effect, as if echoing in.a vast building of fine
acoustic properties. Soon several words of
a Scotch song reached as clearly the young
miner's. ears. :

“The song of the: laké!’ .cried Harry.
#¢Ah, I should be much surprised if it came
from any throat but that of Jog Ryan’s.”

“¢And who is this Jack I Ryan, who' ae in
such a superb fashion?” asked J James Starr.

“An old comrade in the mine,” said Harry.

- He leaned over the landing,

“Ha! Jack!” he cried.

“Is it you Harry?” came
“Wait for me, here I come,’

The song was heard, sweeter: than before.
In a few moments a tall young man, of about
twenty-five; of light figure, smiling eyes,
laughing lips, and with bright golden hair,
appeared at the end of the cone of light
thrown by the lantern, and stepped on the
landing of the fifteenth ladder.

His first act was a hearty shake hands with
Harry. ¢

“Glad to. -meet you,” he cried. © “But
Saint Mungo preserve me! If 1 had known
that you were going te the surface to-day, I
would have spared myself the descent into
the Yarrow shafts.

“Mr. James Starr,” said Harry, “turning
his lamp toward the engineer, who had stood
in the dark.

“Mr, Starr,” said Fok Ryan. “Ah, the
engineer. I would not have recognized you.
Since I've left the mine, my eyes are no
longer accustomed as formerly, to seeing in
the dark.

’ “And I now recall a boy who was always

singing. See the result of ten years practice
my boy! It was you, no doubt.”

“Myself,” Mr. Starr, and, in changing my
trade, I have fot changed in disposition, you
see] Pshaw! it is better to laugh and sing,
- I imagine, than to cry and whine!”

7 “That i so, Jack Ryan. And what have
you been doing since leaving the mine?”

“T worked on a farm at Melrose, near Tr-
