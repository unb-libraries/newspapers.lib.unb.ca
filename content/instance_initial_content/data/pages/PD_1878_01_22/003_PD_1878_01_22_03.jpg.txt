With a flannel round his throat,

Anxious peanut venders hollez,
Scissors grinders’ cracked bells ring
Organ grinders in the guiters

Edison’s Latest Invention.

Yesterday a Gs aarried
what appeared to be a small coffin,
| paused in front of the Old Exchange.
| He was a sad-faced man, and his black
suit glistened in the 'sun-light ‘like an
armor He put down his strange
burden, and bowed to the men stand-
Ing around. Then casting his eyes up
at tho building, he began :

4 Gentlemen, I congratulate you.
You have reared here a structure, whieh
1s second to none in the country.
When you shall have gone to that
bourne from whence no traveller re-
turns,” and he glanced sorrowfully at
the little coffiny “this beautiful build-
ing will remain a monument to your
energy and enterprise. ‘

and he tapped the coffin reverently
with his cane, “which I would not ex-
change for all the wealth of your oil
regions, It is, gentlemen,” and he
began to unscrew the lid, while the
crowd invelnnterily shrank back; “it
is, gentlemen, & rat-trap, which I am
introducing for Mr. Edison, of Menlo
Panky oF 5
The crowd closed up again.

“It is his latest invention, and, as he
says himself, his best. I have handled
a great many rat-traps in'my life, and
I can safely say that this one knoeks
the socks off all of them. “Don't
crowd up too close till I show it tg
you,” and he took off the top and ex-
posed a box with a lot of apartments
communicating with exch other by
little doors, windows and openings of
one kind and sncther. The great in-
ventor nomed this the * Citizens
Savings Rut-trap,” because i ‘openites

“You see, the rat smells the eheese,
and enters by the front door,” and the
trapman indicated the aperture with
his cane; thénee in quest of the eheese,
which is a sort of ignis fatus, througls
this door, which admits him to parlor
A, or the cashier's room.: This decor
eloses behind him, and he passed thenee
to parlor B, or the directors’ room;
this door closes behind him, -as before,
and he proceeds to Parlor C, or the
president's private apartment. By an
ingenious arrangement the closing of
each little door removes the eheese
‘into the next room, in this way always
keeping in one room in udvanee of the
rat that seeks it——until the last room is
reched, (parlor D,) when it is swung
roisclessly to the front apartment. for
the allurement of another . vietim.
Once inside of a door, no rat‘ .can get
out, but rats on the outside can get in,
and do get in, until the trap is full,”

“What's all that got to ‘do with a
savings bank?’ asked a receiving teller
who was in the crowd.

“Everything, my dear friend, evory-
thing,” replied the strange man; “be
cause, you sce, when the trap is full it
closes— liahilitics large; assets nothing.”

I hav finally come to the ¢onelusion
that lager beer as a beverage is not in-
toxicating. +

I have been told by a German who
said he had drunk all mite long, just to
try the experiment, and was abliged to
go home entirely sober in the morning.
I have seen this man drink eighteen
glasses, and if he was drunk ‘it was in
German. and nobody could = under-
stand it. : :

It is proper encugh to state that this
man kept a lager beer saloon, and could
have no objection in stating what was
not strictly thus.

I believe him to, tha full extent of
ability. Inever drank but three glasses
of lager in my life, and that made my
head untwist ag tho it had been hun
on the end of a string, but I was tol
that it was owing to uy big bile being
out of place ; ant I guess that it was so,
for Iynever biled over wus then ‘I did
when I got home that night. My wife
thot that I was going to die, and I was
afraid I shouldn't, for it seemed ‘as tho
everything I had eaten in my life was
coming to the surface, and I believe
that if my wife pulled off my boots just
as she did they would have eome thun-
dering up, too.

0, how sick I wuz! 14 years: ago
and I can taste it\now.

I never had so much oxperience in
such short a time. ©

If any mon shud tell me that lager
beor was not intoxicating, I shud be-
lieve him, but if he should tell me

hat I wasn't drunk thet nite, but that
ny stomach was out of order, I shud
asle him to state over in ‘a few words
just how a man felt and acted when he
was set up. 7 :

If I warn't drunk that nite; I had
some of the most natural simtume that
a man ever had and kept sober.

In the first place it is about eighty
rods from where I drank the lager beer
to my house, and I was jest over two |
hours on the road, and ‘a hole busted
through each one of mi pantaloon neez,
and I didn’t have any hat, and tried to
open the door by the bell-pull and hic-
cuped awfully and saw éverything in

I did not ‘wait long enough for it to
