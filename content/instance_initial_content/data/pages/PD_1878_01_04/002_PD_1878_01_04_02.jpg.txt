 

The Awful Fate
Would not Fake Castor Gil.
[San Francisco Chronicle.]

Once there was a little toy,

IHis mother's pride, his father’s joy.

A right good-natured lad was he,

And hale and hearty as could be.

But once upon an autmn day,

He pushed his dinner-plate away—
‘IT cannot eat to-day,” he said;
¢ I feel an aching in my head,”

His mamma, apprehending harm,

Sent for the dector in alarm,

The doctor came—* Qur little Ned

Is somewhat sickly, ma’any, he said ;
# In order we disease may foil,

He must imbibe some castor oil,”

But Ned declined and shook his head-—
¢ I hate that horrid oil,” he said.

In vain his mamma, dear, implored;

In vain his papa ripped and swored,

They couldn’t get that oil down Ned—
¢ No oil for me,’ he firmly said,

So thinner, thinner every day,

He faded quietly away.

No pies, no cakes, ng-bread, ho meat

Did he have appetite to cat,

And all in vain Lis parcuts toil

To make him take the castor oll—

That nostrum that would ease his pain

And make him well and brisk again.

But Ned refused—so naught could save
The child from an untimely grave;
And thinner, thinner, day by day,

He faded like a dream away.

Till one night by the parlor fire

Bat Edward, ready to expire.

The draft was strong and fiercely drew
And sucked him up the chimney flue.
His poor mamma went nearly wild,
And loud bewailed her foolish child.
But Ned went sailing here and there,
The sport of currents in the air,

Forever tossed by cruel winds,
No peace, no resting place he finds.

And as he tumbles in the skies—
‘* Oh, give me caster oil!" he cries,
“Too late! Too late!’ the wind replies.

How often in your trundle bed
Have you, my child, heard foolish Ned

The horn of the hunter is no longer
heard on the hill. 1t is carried in a
pocket flask.—[Augusta News. Nor
does the hunter, now-a-days, wind his
horn, but his horn frequently winds
him up pretty tight.

Samuel Sticknoy, of Iowa, clasped
his best girl in an embrace so close that
his revolver was discharged, and a boy
standing near was seriously wounded.
The lesson of this sad occurrence is that
boys shouldn't stand around at such
supreme moments,

A country fellow went one night to
see his sweetheart, and for a long time
could think of nothing tosay. At last,
snow beginning to fall heavily, he told
her that his father’s sheep would be
lost. “Well,” said she kindly, taking
him by the hand, “I'll take care of
one of them,”

Out in Austin, Nevada, a young man
asked his lady love if she would ac-
company him to an old folks’ concert.
She flared up at the idea of his calling
her “old folks,” and now he says he
would rather be a widower than marry
a woman so ‘““ touchy” about her age.

A CARLETON ROMANCE.-ITS
BAD BENIN.

 

It was on one of those quiet back streets of
Carleton which remind one so much of the
thoroughfare of a country village, and where
an air of semi-rusticity prevails, thatthe rather
romantic episode we are about to relate took
place. The romance was of the highest order,
and must have more than filled the brightest
dreams of those two romantic young ladies of
Carleton ; but its wind-up, though sudde E
terrible to all concerned, has a pleasafit I
of the ludicrous when viewed by a disint
ed person. Ed

gentlemen, after having safely escortd
ladies on several occasions through the dan
of a trip across the ferry, gallantly paying
fare each time, made it a rule to meet.

noticed that these two dry good clerks were

they rather encouraged them therein, he waxed
exceedingly wroth, and as he considered the
young gentlemen as “fast” and not all desir-
able suitors, he forbade his daughters receiv-
‘ing their attentions. This, as a matter of
course, but added fuel to the fire; and as the
young ladies still allowed the clerks to escort
them to and from church on Sundays, and
heeded not his injunctions in the least, he was
finally driven to the rather desperate measure
of locking them up every Sunday evening in a
back bed-room on the second storey, the win-
dow of which commanded a view of several
sooty fields and Tower hill ; certainly not a
very romantic or pleasing outlook. But
“stone walls do not a prison make” and
“love will find out the way,” and the result
of this move was that the beaux after having
seen the old folks safely in church, would
hasten to the house of their inamoratas,clamber
over the fence into the field, and the girls would
hoist them up to the bed-room widow by
means of a rope extemporized of sheets and
blankets, and there-enjoyed the stolen sweets
of young love until shortly before church came
out. Then the parting kiss would be given,

clerks would go down the rope hand-over-
hand with the agility of a full-fledged salt ora
‘“missing link.” *¢ Stolen fruits are sweet”
runs the saying, and it’s a true one; for these
lovers enjoyed these short stolen meetings
more than if they had met in the front room,
and sat up till three o'clock, once a week, and
nearly ruined papa with a gas bill,

But such romantic wooing could not last
forever. One Sunday evening, the gentle
swains having grown careless through repeated
success, omitted to see the old folks safely in
church as was their wont, but waited until a
few minutes after church went in, and then
started for the abode of their inamoratas. Now
on this particular evening, as fate would have
it, paterfamilias returned home.on some ac-
count, and noticing something of an unknown
nature fluttering from a back window of his
domicile, proceeded to investigate, and arrived
on the scene just as one of the amorous swains

A MAN WHOOUGIIT TO BE BLIND.

 

Peeping Tom, of Coventry, has a
rival ina fashionable quarter of London.
A young married couple took a small
house in a pleasant street, and, after

they had been there a. short time, they 1
noticed spots in the ceiling 0% their |

room. The husband, having a practical
knowledge of building, felt sure that
there was something wrong, and as-
cended into the roof. ‘He found that
the thin partition between his house
and the next had been cut away
sufficiently to allow a man to pass from
one to the other. He ascertained also
that holes had been drilled with a sharp
instrument through the plaster, which
enabled any one on the roof to look into
the room below ; and he discovered also
a man’s pocket handerchief. He watch-
ed night after night in the roof, but no
one came. One day he found his wife
in a state of great alarm. Steps had
been heard over-head, and in her hus-
band’s absence she had sent for a friend,
who even then was watching in the
roof. A few minutes after her husband
arrived they heard a heavy fall and a
cry of “I've got him.” The husban
looked up and found two men wre
ing for very life. So strong was
truder that he managed to get a vay.
from his two assailants, leaving, how-
ever, his waistcoat in their hands. But

they recognized him, and in his waist-

coat pocket they found the instrument

with which he had pierced the ceiling.

He was the son of their next-deor

neighbor. The young scapgrace was

sent out of the country to another,

where strict watch will be kept upon

  

his doings.
