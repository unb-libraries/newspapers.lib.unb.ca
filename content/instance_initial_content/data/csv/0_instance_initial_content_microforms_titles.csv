The new series, published in Ottawa, which began on July 1, 1867, dealt with federal matters.

The Canada Gazette was published in both Kingston, Ontario and Montréal, Québec with the exception of 1850-1851 when edition published in Kingston moved to Toronto, Ontario. One result of Confederation in 1867 was the concurrent publication of two Canada Gazettes until 1869 when the new capital, Ottawa, began publication of its own Canada Gazette (not in our collection). Both series were published weekly on Saturdays by Malcolm Cameron who had become Queen's Printer in 1863. The series which had begun in 1841 continued until the end of 1869 and focused on Ontario and Québec, with greater emphasis placed on Québec. The new series, published in Ottawa, which began on July 1, 1867, dealt with federal matters. The Canada Gazette (1841-1869) was discontinued after the Ontario gazette and the Québec Gazette began to publish in 1868 and 1869 making it redundant.",,,1850,01/01/1850,31/12/1850,1851,01/01/1851,12/07/1853
