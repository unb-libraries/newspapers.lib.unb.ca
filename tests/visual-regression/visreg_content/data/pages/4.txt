     The tinder of this trinket was a young 
     
     and nearlv ruined buonet, Sir Charles 
     
     Avlmcr. uik good looking fellow, too 
     
     blithe-tcmpercd to reckon the. cost ot 
     
     pleasure or to stieklc about the cam- 
     
     panv in which he sought 1t. Iledett a 
     
     handsome fortune on the turf without 
     
    
   
   
    
     losing his reputation with it. He pos- 
     
     sessed certain domestic proclivities 
     
    
   
   
    
     which had survived his acquired ten- 
     
     dencv toward dissipation. Thus his 
     
     visitvto Barnes had been for the purpose 
     
     of seeing an old nurse who had been 
     
     pensioned by his family, and with 
     
     whom he went to take tea once regulan 
     
     1v every quarter. Modest as these en— 
     
     thrtainments were, he rather looked 
     
     forward to and enjoyed them, for nature 
     
     had made him, like. other pigeons, to 
     
     live in a dove-cot, not in the company 
     
     of rocks. However, Charley Aylmer 
     
     rather shirked the idea of a visit'to 
     
     Fulham to renew an aetpiaintance wrth 
     
     people who were evidently not of his 
     
     set, and it is probable that he would 
     
     have simply sent back the bracelet by 
     
     his servant, with a note if the follow- 
     
     ing day had not been Sundays—that is 
     
     of all days he. found it most dithcult to 
     
     spend. To tell the truth, be was also 
     
     a little curious to see whether the, girl 
     
     of eighteen was as pretty 
     
    
   
   
    
     seemed to his indistinct scrutiny in the clerks.

     lunca on sloping garden lawns, full of 
     
     the scent of roses and pinks. Mrs. 
     
     Twillcs invited her guest to dinner on 
     
     the following Thursday; he on his side 
     
     invited a friend who was in the habit 
     
     of giving him boxes for the play (side 
     
     had mentioned she delighted in thea— 
     
     tres), and begged permission to send 
     
     a box promised him for the Gaioty on 
     
     Tuesday. 
     
    

    
     \Yhein a man of thirty has never 
     
     been seriously in love, the, first attack 
     
     of the tender passion is likely to he ‘a 
     
     very sudden and severe one. Sir 
     
     Charles .\ylmer had no idea that he 
     
     was in love with .\da, 
     
     her all that night and the following 
     
     day, and grew dismal lest shc slould 
     
     lezirn that he had frittercd away his 
     
     monev on horses’ legs and should hink 
     
     meanly of him for his folly. ‘ 
     
    

    
     ()n the Tuesday he went into the 
     
     city on business with his stockbizoker, 
     
     and having torn off his gloves in alight- 
     
     ing from his hansom, turned into a 
     
     shop near the exchange to buy zinew 
     
     pair. His amazement may be conceiv- 
     
     ed, when behind the counter I‘ saw
