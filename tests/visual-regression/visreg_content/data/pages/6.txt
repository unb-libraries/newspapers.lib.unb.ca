     those places where justice is dealt out, and 
     
     which sits on one like a nightmare born of a 
     
     heavy and indigestible supper. A dense fog 
     
     hung like a wet blanket over the city, and 
     
     down through it trickled a continuous drimle 
     
     ——not exactly rain, but quite sufﬁcient to wet 
     
     one’s jacket thoroughly. Everything was 
     
     cold, wet and disaurccable, and every one felt 
     
    
   
   
    
     blue.

     hunted up the dust pan and skirmished around 
     
     to see if Briggs had procured the tea leaves, 
     
     but they were not' forthcoming. He then 
     
     took up a seat on the desk over which justic 
     
    

    
     is dispensed, placed his two-sizes-larger-than— 
     
     any—boot—made boots upon two chairs, put 
     
     his hands on the top of the broom handle, 
     
     rested his chin upon his hands, and gave vent 
     
     to the following : 
     
    
   
   
    
     “O Whar am do tea leaves he protnised——-~ 
     
     Dose tea leaves he promised to me ‘3 
     
     Oh, why do he thus deceive me. 
     
     \V'lieu I sigh for dose leaves of de tea? 
     
    
   
   
    
     “No doubt in do pot dey’s reposin’

     1Why he don‘t bring dose. tea leaves to me." 
     
    
   
   
    
     And then he kicked over a chair, whacked 
     
     the floor with the broom and soliloquized. 
     
     “I wonder why (lat ar man don’t bring

     sprinkle dc ﬂo’ with him, and den sweep out 
     
     with the hair ob his head! I will, by goliy 1” 
     
     And he jumped down and he ran sweeping 
     
    
   
   
    
     1 
     
    
   
   
    
     with such vigor that if tne matting hadn’t been 
     
     fastened down with spikes instead of tacks, 
     
     he’d surely have torn it up. 
     
    

    
     By the time he had swept up and dusted, 
     
     several of the force dropped in, and while 
     
     waiting for his Honor to come, they beguiled 
     
     the weary hour discussing popular topics, such 
     
     as the elections, the prospects of war or peace, 
     
     etc., while the janitor armed himself with a 
     
     crow bar and took up a position behind the 
     
     door to smite Briggs the moment he entered. 
     
     There was also a strange man there awaiting 
     
     the opening of court, and he beguiled the 
     
     time listening to them. His clothes were 
     
     ragged and dirty, his hair long and matted, 
     
     and his hat was all rim, the crown having 
     
     given away under the ravages of time, or was 
     
     removed for the sake of ventilation. He 
     
     listened attentively for a time, and then sud- 
     
     denly interupted them by saying : “Gentle— 
     
     men, these are certainly subjects of great in - 
     
     portance, but I know of one of much greater 
     
     importance than any of them and more worthy 
     
     of discussion; it is—‘Nlmt shall we do with 
     
     the man who smokes his cigar down so small 
     
     that a poor man can’t get two \vhiffs out of it 
     
     after he has done P” 
     
    

    
     It was evidently to abstract a subject, or 
     
     no one ansv.'ered, and after a pause the stran- 
     
     ger went on : 
     
    

    
     “Gentlemen, there are some mighty mean 
     
     men in this world, but thank the Lord! I 
     
     ain’t one of ’em; if I am poor I ain’t mean. 
     
     Now there are hundreds of men, gentlemen, 
     
    

    
     who smoke their cigars clear down to the 
     
     small end of nothing, and I’m darned if they 
     
     ain’t the meanest men of all. If you were to 
     
     ask me what I consider generosity in a man, 
     
     I would answer the throwing away of half a 
     
     cigar, The man who does that is bound to 
     
     prosper, for he remembers the poor. I re» 
     
     marked that some men smoked their cigars 
     
     clean down to the small end of nothing, and 
     
     that I considered them the meanest of mean 
     
     men; but, gentlemen, once in my life I stmck a 
     
     man who was meancr than the meanest ofmen. 
     
     I saw him buy a cigar one night, and follow- 
     
     ed ,him up for the butt, as I hadn’t had a 
     
     smoke for a long time. He strolled along 
     
     smoking, and I followed like a shadow sniff 
     
     ing thegfragrant cloud that drifted behind him. 
     
     Half the cigar was gone and my mouth was 
     
     watering; I prayed that he would throw it 
     
     away, but he didn’t. He still walked on and 
     
     kept smoking, and as the cigar burnt down,my 
     
     hopes of a big smoke feel in proportion. 
     
     But at last, when the cigar was all gone but

     thought that he was almighty careful of fire ; 
     
     and then lie—threw it away you suppose? not 
     
     a bit of it; he put it in his mouth and began 
     
     to chew it. Gentlemen, it was a an awful 
     
     ncut. I have been shipwrecked, lifterl

     now, gentlemen, that I ask, what shall we do 
     
     with the. man who smokes his cigar clean 
     
     down to the small end of nothing? And can 
     
     any of you oblige me with a chew.” 
     
     lint none of them felt obliging, and the 
     
     stranger heaved a great sigh and said : 
     
    

    
     “lVell, I suppose I’ll have to take a chew 
     
     of my own.” 
     
    

    
     And he produced an old cigar butt, which 
     
     be carefully unrolled; and then began a vig- 
     
     orous rumination with equally vigorous ex- 
     
     pectoration at intervals; while the members 
     
     of the force present, including the janitor, 
     
     fell to thinking of some punishment for the man 
     
     who was guilty of such an Offence as the 
     
     stranger mentioned, and remained buried in 
     
     meditation until the entrance of his Ho‘nor.

     He looked like, a t‘ , it, for his ragged clothes might 
     
     Have been used to dress up a scar-crow, 
     
    
   
   
    
       
     
    
   
   
    
     Such was 
     
     WILLIAM NEAT, 
     
     Monday morning, when he stepped out and 
     
     toed the mark in answer to his name. 
     
    

    
     “ \Villiam,” said his Honor, biting the end 
     
     of his pen, “ you took some whiskey neat 
     
     and it did the business for you, and you came 
     
     rolling along Charlotte street towards morn— 
     
     ing with your legs tangled up, your hat on the 
     
     back of your head, and an air that impressed 
     
     one with the idea that you owned the whole 
     
     town. 
     
     war-dance, and wound it up by coming down 
     
     on the broad of your back and covered your- 
     
     self with dust. 
     
     and attempted to rub the dust off against some 
     
    
   
   
    
     You shortly proceeded to perform it 
     
    
   
   
    
     Then you picked yourself up 
     
    
   
   
    
     shutters, but luck was against you and the 
     
     shutters came off ﬁrst, and down you went 
     
     again with shutters on top and all around you. 
     
     You were picked up by a stranger who con- 
     
     siderately picked the shutters out of your 
     
     clothes and attempted to dust you off, when 
     
     you returned his kindness by shaking him off 
     
     and enquiring in a loud but unsteady voice 
     
     what the deuce he meant by throwing a house 
     
     at you. But the stranger didn’t give an an- 
     
     swer that satisfied you, so you fell upon him 
     
     and smote him grievously upon the end of his 
     
     nose and made the sparks fly out of his eyes; 
     
     then grabbed him by the coat tails, split his 
     
     coat clear up the back, passed the two halves 
     
     round his neck, and tied them in a bownot 
     
     n front, and you were frantically trying to get 
     
     iis leg over his shoulder, when the police 
     
     Now, \Villiam, it 
     
     seems to me that yours is a particularly ag-

     Now I think that a few 
     
     days sojurn from the cares of life with health- 
     
     ful labor would benefit you, so I send you up 
     
     for ten days.” 
     
    
   
   
    
     tough customer. 
     
    
   
   
    
     “But, your Honor,” put in the prisoner, it’s 
     
     my ﬁrst offence.” 
     
    

    
     “I have taken that into consideration, also 
     
     the fact that elections are coming on, and a 
     
     man can get drunk at a small expense ; and 
     
     for the benefit of the community at large, and 
     
     the candidates in particular, I send you up. 
     
     Imagine how any of the candioates would 
     
     look with his coat split up the back and the 
     
     tails doing the duty of a cravet ; for it’s just 
     
     possible, William, that you will go through 
     
     the same performance on election day as you 
     
     did Saturday night.” \ 
     
    

    
     And the prisoner took a back seat and 
     
     smiled to think how ludicrous they would 
     
     look with their coat tails tied under their 
     
     chains.

     fore he struck his own . house, and then his 
     
     \vif‘ repudiated him, and refused to open the 
     
     door. She put her head out the window and 
     
     he retreated to the middle of the street with 
     
     the bell knob in his hand; and after she had 
     
     gazed upon the star lit sky for a moment, 
     
     she said : 
     
    

    
     “Charles, what ails you P” . 
     
    

    
     “jes’ come (Lie 1) down to door, my dear,

     “Charles, you‘re thunk.” 
     
    

    
     “My dear, you surely can’t slice straight ?" 
     
    

    
     “No need of seeing; I can smell the liquor, 
     
     and, 0h, gracious! you’ve been”~« 
     
    

    
     “Doin’ what, love?” 
     
    

    
     “—You’ve been eating onions! oh, you 
     
     brute! It’s bad enough to have you come 
     
     home drunk and smell of mm, but to have 
     
     you smell of both rum and onions! you can’t 
     
     get in.” And with a shriek that made a

     “Charles,” said his Honor, “you were ex- 
     
     cited about the elections last Saturday night, 
     
     went into a bar-room, drunk the healths of 
     
     the candidates all round about half a dozen 
     
     times, and got awfully drunk. You were 
     
     and in getting home you woke up nearly every 
     
     person on the street you lived on by ringing 
     
     bells, pounding at doors, and throwing hand 
     
     fuls of gravel against the windows; and 
     
     about three o’clock Sunday morning you 
     
     were found sitting on a door step tying knots 
     
     I'm afraid, Charles that I’ll 
     
     have to trouble you for $8.” 
     
    

    
     “No trouble in the world,” said Charles, 
     
     producing the required sum. “One’s apt to 
     
     get a little bit so—so before and during

     And as he walked out into the corridor he 
     
     replied : “Tulips l” 
     
    
   
   
    
     Tears of pity were shed for him, and the 
     
     janitor muttered between his tdeth in the most 
     
     approved melodramatic manner. “Away with
